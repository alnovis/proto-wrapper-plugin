# Generator factory service provider configuration
#
# The default Java factory is registered programmatically in GeneratorFactoryRegistry.
# Additional custom factories can be auto-discovered by adding their fully qualified
# class names here. Each factory implementation must have a public no-arg constructor.
#
# Example:
# com.example.kotlin.KotlinGeneratorFactory
